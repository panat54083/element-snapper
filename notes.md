# Element Snapper - Feature Ideas

## Planned Features

### Action Buttons

[x] **Visible Area (viewport)** - Capture current visible viewport only (no scrolling)
[x] **Full Page (scrolling)** - Capture entire scrollable page with auto-scroll
[ ] **Selected Portion** - Capture user-defined area by click-and-drag selection

### Settings Options

[x] **Copy to Clipboard** - Skip download, copy directly to clipboard
[x] **Delayed Capture** - Add countdown timer before capture (useful for hover states, menus)

### Bug

[x] Black line when capturing more than 2 tiles, it is compromise when i change the scroll behavior to instant
[x] Unable to copy to clipboard when using "visible area" and "full page" capture.
